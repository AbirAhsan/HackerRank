# Arithmetic Operators

# Task
# The provided code stub reads two integers from STDIN a and b. Add code to print three lines where:
# 1. The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.
# 2. The second line contains the difference of the two numbers(first - second).
# 3. The third line contains the product of the two numbers

# 8
# -2
# 15

# Input Format
# The first line contains the first integer, a.
# The second line contains the second integer, b.

# Output Format
# Print the three lines as explained above.


# Sample Input :
# 3
# 2

# Sample Output :
# 5
# 1
# 6


# if __name__ == '__main__':
a = int(input())
b = int(input())

sumation = a + b
dif = a - b
multiplication = a*b
print(sumation)
print(dif)
print(multiplication)
